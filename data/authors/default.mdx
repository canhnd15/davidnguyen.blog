Welcome to my blog! I'm David, a software engineer living and working in Hanoi, Vietnam.

I primarily work as a back-end engineer using the Java programming language and the Spring framework.
Additionally, I use JavaScript and front-end technologies to develop personal projects.

I love reading and writing, which is why I created this blog.
It's a place where I document my stories and journey, and also where I share the knowledge and experiences I've gained.

I believe we all come to this world with a destiny and a mission. While fate may be unavoidable,
our mission is something we can change and complete. Some people spend a lifetime searching for it,
while others find it early. With faith, we will definitely find it.

**Just do it!**
