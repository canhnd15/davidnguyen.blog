summary: Software development is a process; you can't perfect it immediately, but you can continuously improve it. Therefore, you need CI/CD to streamline the workflow and enhance overall efficiency. In this article, we will explore how to use GitHub Actions to create pipelines for developing a Spring Boot application and using Docker for dockerizing.

# 1. What are we going to do?

- In this post, we will create a simple Spring Boot application and then use the GitHub actions for automatically build and create Docker image for the application.

- Finally, we will push the created image to DockerHub and then run our application as Docker container based on that image.

- This is the flow of our project:

# 2. Create a Spring Boot project

- To focus on the main content of the article about CI/CD with GitHub Actions, you can create a simple Spring Boot application using [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/)

- The Spring Boot application will public an APIs with endpoint: `/api/v1/users/` and return list of users as a JSON object.

- Find more details about the source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/canhnd15/cicd-github-actions).

# 3. Write the files to define the pipelines.

- Next, we need to create the necessary files to define the steps for GitHub Actions to follow in building and creating a Docker image from our source code.

- In real projects, we often work with multiple environments when developing an application. In this post, I'll assume we have two environments: development and production.

- Of course, we also have two Git branches: `dev` for the development environment and `master` for the production environment.

- To enable GitHub Actions to trigger our application, we need to create the following folder and files: `dev.yml`, `prod.yml`

```text
spring-boot-project/
│
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── dev.yml
│       └── prod.yml
│
├── src/
├── pom.xml
└── README.md
```

- Content of the `dev.yml`:

```yml
name: CI pipeline - Development env # Name of the workflow. This will be shown in GitHub Actions interface.

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev # Trigger this workflow when there is a push to the 'dev' branch.

jobs:
  build-deploy: # Define a job named 'build-deploy'.
    name: Build and deploy with GitHub Actions # Name of the job, displayed in the GitHub Actions UI.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Specify the type of runner to use (latest version of Ubuntu).

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code # Step to check out the repository's code.
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Uses the 'actions/checkout' action to pull the code from the repository.

      - name: Setup JDK 17 # Step to set up Java Development Kit (JDK) 17.
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3 # Uses the 'actions/setup-java' action to configure the Java environment.
        with:
          distribution: 'corretto' # Use the Corretto distribution of JDK.
          java-version: 17 # Set up JDK version 17.

      - name: Run tests # Step to run tests using Maven.
        run: mvn -B test --file pom.xml # Runs Maven in batch mode to execute tests defined in the 'pom.xml' file.

      - name: Build with Maven # Step to build the application using Maven.
        run: |
          mvn -B package --file pom.xml  # Runs Maven in batch mode to package the application as defined in the 'pom.xml' file.
```

- Content of the `prod.yml`:

```yml
name: CI pipeline - Product env # Name of the workflow. This will be shown in GitHub Actions interface.

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Trigger this workflow when there is a push to the 'master' branch.

jobs:
  build-deploy: # Define a job named 'build-deploy'.
    name: Build and deploy with GitHub Actions # Name of the job, displayed in the GitHub Actions UI.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Specify the type of runner to use (latest version of Ubuntu).

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code # Step to check out the repository's code.
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Uses the 'actions/checkout' action to pull the code from the repository.

      - name: Setup JDK 17 # Step to set up Java Development Kit (JDK) 17.
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3 # Uses the 'actions/setup-java' action to configure the Java environment.
        with:
          distribution: 'corretto' # Use the Corretto distribution of JDK.
          java-version: 17 # Set up JDK version 17.

      - name: Build with Maven # Step to build the application using Maven.
        run: |
          mvn clean package -DskipTests  # Runs Maven to clean and package the application, skipping tests.
```

- As you can see, in `dev.yml` I used the `dev` branch, and in `prod.yml` I used the `prod` branch.

- n the development environment, I use Maven to run tests and build the application. However, in the production environment, I use Maven only for building and skip the tests.

=> This approach assumes that if the application works correctly in the development environment, it should also work fine in the production environment.

# 4. Test the pipelines.

- To test the pipelines, push your code to a GitHub repository and navigate to the Actions tab in that repository.

![Alt text](/static/img/posts/cicd/actionspage.png 'image')

- GitHub Actions will scan all files in the `workflows` directory and trigger the appropriate workflow based on the push event for the specific branch.

- For example, when you push code to the `dev` branch, GitHub Actions will run the pipeline defined in `dev.yml` for changes on the `dev` branch.

![Alt text](/static/img/posts/cicd/actionsdev.png 'image')

- Here is an example of steps when we build and deploy successfully with GitHub Actions.

# 5. Add Docker steps.

### 5.1 - Dockerfile

- Now that our pipelines are working correctly, we'll add Docker steps to build an image and push it to Docker.

- To build a Docker image from our application, we need a Dockerfile that defines the steps for running a Spring Boot application by executing a .jar file.

- Here is our Dockerfile (make sure to push it to all branches of the repository).

```yml
FROM openjdk:17-jdk

WORKDIR /app

COPY target/cicd-demo-*.jar /app/cicd-demo.jar

EXPOSE 8090

CMD ["java", "-jar", "cicd-demo.jar"]
```

=> Note that you may need to modify this Dockerfile to suit your specific application.

### 5.2 - Docker steps for the pipelines

- We have three Docker steps: building a Docker image, logging in to DockerHub, and then pushing the image to DockerHub.

- Before defining the steps, we need to create DockerHub secret information and add it to our GitHub repository. This will allow our GitHub Actions workflow to communicate with DockerHub.

=> 1. Login to your DockerHub account -> Settings -> Personal access token.

![Alt text](/static/img/posts/cicd/dockerhub1.png 'image')

=> 2. Generate new access token.

![Alt text](/static/img/posts/cicd/dockerhub2.png 'image')

=> 3. Copy the access token.

![Alt text](/static/img/posts/cicd/dockerhub3.png 'image')

=> 4. Navigate to the Settings tab on you github repository -> Secrets and variables -> Actions

![Alt text](/static/img/posts/cicd/dockerhub4.png 'image')

=> 5. Create new repository secret.

![Alt text](/static/img/posts/cicd/dockerhub5.png 'image')

- After adding the secrets, we will modify the `dev.yml` and `prod.yml` files to include the Docker steps.

=> `dev.yml` for development environment.

```yml
name: CI pipeline - Development env

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    name: Build and deploy with GitHub Actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'corretto'
          java-version: 17

      - name: Run tests
        run: mvn -B test --file pom.xml

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: |
          echo "Build on dev environment"
          mvn -B package --file pom.xml

      # Define step for building Docker image based on Dockerfile
      - name: Build Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
          push: false
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/cicd-demo:1.0.0

      # Define step for logging DockerHub
      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_DEV }}

      # Define step for pushing image to the DockerHub
      - name: Push image to DockerHub
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/cicd-demo:1.0.0
```

=> `prod.yml` for production environment.

```yml
name: CI pipeline - Product env

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    name: Build and deploy with GitHub Actions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'corretto'
          java-version: 17

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: |
          echo "Build on product environment"
          mvn clean package -DskipTests

      # Define step for building Docker image based on Dockerfile
      - name: Build Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
          push: false
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/cicd-demo-prod:1.0.0

      # Define step for logging DockerHub
      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_PROD }}

      # Define step for pushing image to the DockerHub
      - name: Push image to DockerHub
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/cicd-demo-prod:1.0.0
```

=> Now push the code to GitHub and test whether the pipelines in the development and production environments are working correctly.

- If everything is fine, you will see that our Docker images have been pushed to DockerHub.

![Alt text](/static/img/posts/cicd/dockerhub6.png 'image')

# 6. Running application as Docker container.

- To run the application based on created image as Docker container you run the following commands.

=> This for product environment:

```sh
docker run --name cicd-demo-prod -d -p 8090:8090 canhnd15/cicd-demo-prod:1.0.0
```

=> Or this for develop environment:

```sh
docker run --name cicd-demo-dev -d -p 8090:8090 canhnd15/cicd-demo:1.0.0
```

- Once all the containers are running, you can make an HTTP request to test the application. For example:

=> Request:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8090/api/v1/users/
```

=> Response:

```JSON
{"message":"get users successfully!","code":100,"response":[{"firstName":"firstname 0","lastName":"lastname 0","username":"username 0","email":"email_0@gmail.com"},{"firstName":"firstname 1","lastName":"lastname 1","username":"username 1","email":"email_1@gmail.com"},{"firstName":"firstname 2","lastName":"lastname 2","username":"username 2","email":"email_2@gmail.com"},{"firstName":"firstname 3","lastName":"lastname 3","username":"username 3","email":"email_3@gmail.com"},{"firstName":"firstname 4","lastName":"lastname 4","username":"username 4","email":"email_4@gmail.com"},{"firstName":"firstname 5","lastName":"lastname 5","username":"username 5","email":"email_5@gmail.com"},{"firstName":"firstname 6","lastName":"lastname 6","username":"username 6","email":"email_6@gmail.com"},{"firstName":"firstname 7","lastName":"lastname 7","username":"username 7","email":"email_7@gmail.com"},{"firstName":"firstname 8","lastName":"lastname 8","username":"username 8","email":"email_8@gmail.com"},{"firstName":"firstname 9","lastName":"lastname 9","username":"username 9","email":"email_9@gmail.com"}]}
```

# 7. Summary.

In this post, we explored how to use GitHub Actions to create an CI pipeline for building and deploying our Spring Boot application. Although this project is a simple demo, it provides a fundamental understanding for beginners and is easy to develop. I hope you find it helpful and that you learn something valuable from it!
