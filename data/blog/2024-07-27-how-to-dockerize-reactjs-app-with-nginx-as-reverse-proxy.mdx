summary: In the previous post, we explored the process of containerizing a backend service using Spring Boot. In this post, we will delve into how to containerize a frontend application built with React, using Nginx as the web server.

# 1. Create a ReactJS application?

- To create a React application I will use Vite - a modern front-end build tool that provides a fast development environment and optimized build for production. It is particularly designed for modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js, React, and others.

- You can follow the commands below:

```sh
npm create vite@<version>`
```

- For example:

```sh
npm create vite@latest #for latest version
```

```sh
npm create vite@4 #for version 4
```

- After running that commands, you have to make some choices.

  - Project's name: dockerize-reactjs-app
  - Frameworks: React
  - Variant: JavaScript

- Move to the root folder of your project.

```sh
cd dockerize-reactjs-app
```

- Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

- Run the application

```sh
npm run dev
```

=> Our React application will be started at port [5173](http://localhost:5173/)

**Note**: If you are not using Vite, you can use this command:

```sh
npx create-react-app dockerize-reactjs-app
```

# 2. Dockerfile

- When you run the React application locally on your machine, you just need to use `npm run dev`. However, if you want your application to run on a server, you need to build your application to static files and then transfer them to the web server (Nginx).

- In this post, we use Dockerfile to create an image and then run a Docker container based on that image as an application.

- Create `Dockerfile` in root folder of the project and `Dockerfile` will contain two parts:

  - Define steps to build our application.

```sh
# Use Node.js version 16 as the base image and name this stage "build-stage"
FROM node:16 as build-stage #

# Set the working directory inside the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the dependencies specified in package.json
RUN npm install

# Copy all files from the current directory to the working directory in the container
COPY . .

# Build the application using the npm run build script defined in package.json
RUN npm run build
```

- Define steps to use Nginx as web server.

```sh
# Use the official Nginx image based on Alpine Linux as the base image
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the custom nginx.conf configuration file from the local machine to the container
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Copy the built application files from the build stage to the Nginx HTML directory
COPY --from=build-stage /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to allow traffic to the Nginx server
EXPOSE 80
```

# 3. Nginx configuration file.

- To run our Nginx server, we need to define some server configurations for the Nginx.

- Create `nginx.conf` configuration file in root folder of the project (same level with Dockerfile) with content below.

```sh
# Defining global events configuration, though it is empty for our basic setup.
events {}

# Defines server configurations.
http {
    # Defines a server block, which specifies how to handle requests for a specific domain or IP.
    server {
        # Listen on port 80 for incoming HTTP requests.
        listen 80;

        # This location block handles requests to the root URL ("/").
        location / {
            root /usr/share/nginx/html; # Set the root directory for serving files.
            index index.html; # Specify the default file to serve if the directory is requested.
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html; # Try to serve the requested URI, and if it is not found, fall back to index.html.
        }

        # This location block handles requests for JavaScript and CSS files.
        location ~ \.(js|css)$ {
            root /usr/share/nginx/html; # Set the root directory for serving files.
            include /etc/nginx/mime.types; # Include the MIME types file to ensure the correct content type is set for these files.
        }

        # This catch-all location block handles any other requests (e.g., routes in a SPA).
        location ~ ^/.+$ {
            root /usr/share/nginx/html; # Set the root directory for serving files.
            index index.html; # Specify the default file to serve if the directory is requested.
            try_files $uri /index.html; # Try to serve the requested URI, and if it is not found, fall back to index.html.
        }
    }
}
```

# 4. Build an image from Dockerfile.

- To deploy our application as a Docker container, we first need to create a Docker image. To build our application into a Docker image, navigate to the root directory (where the Dockerfile is located) and execute the following command:

```sh
docker build -t dockerize-reactjs-app:1.0.0 .
```

- Now that we have created a Docker image of our React application, you can push this image to DockerHub using the following commands:

- Login to Docker:

```sh
docker login
```

- Create tag for the image:

```sh
docker tag dockerize-reactjs-app:1.0.0 <your DockerHub username>/dockerize-reactjs-app:1.0.0
```

- Push image to the DockerHub:

```sh
docker push <your DockerHub username>/dockerize-reactjs-app:1.0.0
```

# 5. Run application as Docker container.

- Finally, to run our application as Docker container you can following this command:

```sh
docker run --name dockerize-reactjs-app -dp 8080:80 dockerize-reactjs-app:1.0.0
```

- Our React application is now running as a Docker container. You can access the application from your local machine on port 8080, which is mapped to port 80 within the container.

# 6. Summary

In this post, we explored how to dockerize a React application using Docker. Although this project is a simple demo, it provides a fundamental understanding for beginners and is easy to develop. I hope you find it helpful and that you learn something valuable from it!
