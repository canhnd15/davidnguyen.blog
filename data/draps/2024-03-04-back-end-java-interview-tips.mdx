### Before the interview:

1. Most interviewers will ask about the details you've provided in your CV.

- Programing languages
- Frameworks
- Libraries
- Database
- Working experience (previous projects, tech stacks)

⇒ Prepare good answers for the details you’ve provided in your CV.

2. Conduct research about the job, position, and company that you've applied to before the interview.

- Read the job descriptions and requirements.
- You can find the company's websites, pages or blogs to read about the company first (their projects, business, tech stacks...).

3. When you asked about range of salary that you want before the interview.

- The company has a salary range and they want to find a candidate who adapt the job requirements but no need to be very well.
- That mean if you have a well behavior in the interview, you can answer all of the questions of the interviews and then I ask for a salary range
  that much higher than their salary range for that position -> maybe you will be rejected.

4. HR ask you about your future plans.

- Maybe the team that you will work with if pass the interview is stable.
- They need a candidate who will commit to work for long time.

5. HR ask can you onboard immediately?
6. HR asked you about ref check?
7. Red flag
   - Commitment for x years while they are not support you any things (courses, training…)
   - Basic benefits for new employees are difference with old employees (vehicle park, working time)

### In the interview:

- Speak more slowly and clearly, focus on the question, and avoid talking too much.
- Think about the answer before speaking about it.
- Admit "I don't know" when you're unsure. Don't attempt to explain things you don't fully understand.
- Be yourself and remain confident. Regardless of whether you succeed or fail in the interview, you will always learn something new. Keep things simple and stay relaxed.
- You can ask the interviewer to explain any question that you don't know or don't fully understand.
- Use body language and maintain eye contact with the interviewers.
- Demonstrate your passion and dedication for the job to the interviewers.

### After the interview:

1. Always say “thanks” with the interviewers.
2. Reply the result email even if you got an offer or not.
3. If the interviewer only asked about what he know and don’t ask about things you have done before → you might not want to work with him in the future.
4. Take notes about the interview
   - Questions that you did not answer well.
