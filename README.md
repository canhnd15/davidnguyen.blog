- [Demo Blog](https://davidnguyen.blog) - this repo

## 2. How to customize this blog

### Get the code

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/canhnd15/davidnguyen.blog.git
```

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Edit the layout in `app` or content in `data`. With live reloading, the pages auto-updates as you edit them.

## 3. Extend

`data/siteMetadata.js` - contains most of the site related information which should be modified for a user's need.

`data/authors/default.md` - default author information (required). Additional authors can be added as files in `data/authors`.

`data/projectsData.js` - data used to generate styled card on the projects page.

`data/headerNavLinks.js` - navigation links.

`data/logo.svg` - replace with your own logo.

`data/blog` - replace with your own blog posts.

`public/static` - store assets such as images and favicons.

`tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css` - tailwind configuration and stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of the site.

`css/prism.css` - controls the styles associated with the code blocks. Feel free to customize it and use your preferred prismjs theme e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

`contentlayer.config.ts` - configuration for Contentlayer, including definition of content sources and MDX plugins used. See [Contentlayer documentation](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started) for more information.

`components/MDXComponents.js` - pass your own JSX code or React component by specifying it over here. You can then use them directly in the `.mdx` or `.md` file. By default, a custom link, `next/image` component, table of contents component and Newsletter form are passed down. Note that the components should be default exported to avoid [existing issues with Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/51593).

`layouts` - main templates used in pages:

- There are currently 3 post layouts available: `PostLayout`, `PostSimple` and `PostBanner`. `PostLayout` is the default 2 column layout with meta and author information. `PostSimple` is a simplified version of `PostLayout`, while `PostBanner` features a banner image.
- There are 2 blog listing layouts: `ListLayout`, the layout used in version 1 of the template with a search bar and `ListLayoutWithTags`, currently used in version 2, which omits the search bar but includes a sidebar with information on the tags.

`app` - pages to route to. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) for more information.

`next.config.js` - configuration related to Next.js. You need to adapt the Content Security Policy if you want to load scripts, images etc. from other domains.

## 4. Deploy

**Vercel**  
The easiest way to deploy the template is to deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

**Netlify**
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)’s Next.js runtime configures enables key Next.js functionality on your website without the need for additional configurations. Netlify generates serverless functions that will handle Next.js functionalities such as server-side rendered (SSR) pages, incremental static regeneration (ISR), `next/images`, etc.

See [Next.js on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/next-js/overview/#next-js-runtime) for suggested configuration values and more details.

**Static hosting services / GitHub Pages / S3 / Firebase etc.**

1. Add `output: 'export'` in `next.config.js`. See [static exports documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#configuration) for more information.
2. Change `components/Image.tsx` to use a standard `<img>` tag instead of `next/image`. Alternatively, to continue using `next/image`, you can use an alternative image optimization provider such as Imgix, Cloudinary or Akamai. See [image optimization documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#image-optimization) for more details.
3. Remove `api` folder and components which call the server-side function such as the Newsletter component.
4. Run `yarn build`. The generated static content is in the `out` folder.
